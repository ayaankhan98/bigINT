### Contributions

Contributors are welcome!

Currently we have the minimal project setup, we will keep on improving the repository standards as soon as we progress.

We aim to build a library for C++ 17 or above for big integer support

- Feel free to give suggestions or point bugs by rasing issues

#### Required setup
- CMake 3.16.8 or above
- GCC 9
- C++ 17
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char ch;
	const char *fileName="test.txt";
	
	//declare object
	ifstream file;
	
	//open file
	file.open(fileName,ios::in);
	if(!file)
	{
		cout<<"Error in opening file!!!"<<endl;
		return -1; //return from main
	}
	
	//read and print file content
	while (!file.eof()) 
	{
		file >> noskipws >> ch;	//reading from file
		cout << ch;	//printing
	}
	//close the file
	file.close();
	
	return 0;
